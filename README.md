# QRCode Maker
You can make your QRCode and look back at it at any time!

## What we can do?
There are two main things you can do in this app!\
The first is that by filling in the url and message, QRCode that displays them can be generated automatically.\
Second, by creating your own account, you can manage the QRCode you have created in the past and check it anytime!
